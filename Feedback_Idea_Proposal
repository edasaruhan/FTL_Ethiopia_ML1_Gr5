Thank you for the thoughtful and socially impactful proposal — addressing education quality and personalization for Ethiopian students is a powerful and timely initiative. The project shows a strong understanding of the local educational context, especially by framing the EUEE exam as a clear and measurable use case. Your integration of learning styles, past academic performance, and behavioral data reflects a comprehensive and student-centered approach. The use of interpretable ML methods like Decision Trees and Collaborative Filtering is appropriate and well-justified, especially for early-stage deployment.

To make the project more novel and effective, consider incorporating affective computing elements, such as analyzing students’ emotional responses or motivation levels (e.g., through sentiment in open-ended answers or webcam-based emotion recognition, if feasible), which can significantly enrich personalization. You might also benefit from exploring reinforcement learning for adaptive content delivery that evolves as student engagement changes. For richer benchmarking and validation, you could explore datasets or systems like EdNet, ASSISTments, or Khan Academy student logs, which offer large-scale interaction data and can inform system design. Finally, co-creating learning materials with Ethiopian teachers and incorporating local language and cultural references could boost both relevance and long-term adoption.
